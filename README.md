### Refactored Code Time Performance
## Summary
An advantage of refactoring code is that you can improve it and make it more able to be used in differing contexts. Improvements to the logic can increase efficiency and make code more usable. Refactoring old code can also save time if the alternative is starting new code from scratch. A disadvantage of refactoring code is that it can introduce errors into your code, and if you already have functioning code it may not be worth the time and effort. 
The original VBA script was advantageous because it provided a succint workbook for Steve to analyze his stocks of interest. The refactored code is advantageous because it ran faster and can be more easily applied to another set of data.
